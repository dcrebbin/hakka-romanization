# Hakka Pha̍k-fa-sṳ Romanization

This project aims to correctly produce a Chinese character to romanization mapping for the Hakka language using the Pha̍k-fa-sṳ style of romanization.
It aims to does this by scraping bible.com for both the Chinese Hakka & Pha̍k-fa-sṳ versions of the bible.

In theory, these 2 are complete identical in content which with the correct sanitization code should produce an accurate mapping of the romanization.
